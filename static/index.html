                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since the close of the Second Vatican Councel in 1965, a revolution has taken
                        place in the Catholic Church. The Mass has been changed. The Sacraments have been
                        changed. And in so many places the doctrine, as well as the moral teaching of the 
                        Church has been changed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We believe these changes are irreconcilable with what the popes have taught,
                        especially the pre-Vatican II popes of the last 200 years. And so we do not go
                        along with the changes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Until such time as Our Lord restores order and normalcy as regards the situation
                        in the Church, we hold fast, as St. Paul said, to the TRADITIONS.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In this chapel, only the traditional Latin Mass is celebrated. And we adhere without
                        reservation or qualification to the traditional Catholic Faith and the unchangeable moral
                        teaching of the Church. We believe that as Catholics we have a right and a solemn duty to 
                        hold fast to the traditions as we have received them from the Church.

                    <h2>Dress Code</h2>
                    
                    <p>You are most welcome to come and assist at Mass. Be advised that we do enforce a dress code while on church property</p>

                    <p class="spacing">According to Apostolic Tradition and out of respect for our Lord's presence in the Most Blessed Sacrament, the faithful 
                       must dress modestly while in the church and assisting at Holy Mass. Hence, please observe the following rules:</p>

                    <p class="spacing">Women and girls must wear a modest dress and cover their heads with either a hat or chapel veil. Short skirts 
                       or dresses that are above the knees, revealing blouses (such as low cut, sleeveless or see-through), slacks or 
                       shorts of any length do not meet the norms of Christian modesty.</p>

                    <p class="spacing">Men and boys should be wearing neat trousers, a coat, jacket or a dress sweater
                        and tie. Jeans, shorts, open shirts, sneakers and other such casual dress are inappropriate and do not meet the standards 
                        for Mass.</p>
                        
                    <p class="spacing">Please be advised that the priest reserves the right to refuse Holy Communion to anyone, who in his prudent judgment,
                       does not meet the requirements of the Rules for Receiving Holy Communion and Dress Code as stated above.</p>
