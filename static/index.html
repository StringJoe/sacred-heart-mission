                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since the close of the Second Vatican Councel in 1965, a revolution has taken
                        place in the Catholic Church. The Mass has been changed. The Sacraments have been
                        changed. And in so many places the doctrine, as well as the moral teaching of the 
                        Church has been changed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We believe these changes are irreconcilable with what the popes have taught,
                        especially the pre-Vatican II popes of the last 200 years. And so we do not go
                        along with the changes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Until such time as Our Lord restores order and normalcy as regards the situation
                        in the Church, we hold fast, as St. Paul said, to the TRADITIONS.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In this chapel, only the traditional Latin Mass is celebrated. And we adhere without
                        reservation or qualification to the traditional Catholic Faith and the unchangeable moral
                        teaching of the Church. We believe that as Catholics we have a right and a solemn duty to 
                        hold fast to the traditions as we have received them from the Church.
